# 4 digits 7-segment decoder VHDL
## Description

The "4 digits 7-segment decoder VHDL" is a VHDL project designed to decode hexadecimal values and display them on 7-segment displays. Unlike a BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) decoder (7447 for example), which only accepts numbers from 0 to 9, this decoder accepts values from 0 to F in hexadecimal. Thus, it can display numbers from 0000 to FFFF.

## Features

* Hexadecimal Decoding: Capable of decoding values from 0 to F and displaying them on 7-segment displays.
* 4-Digit Display: Displays complete hexadecimal numbers on four 7-segment displays, allowing visualization from 0000 to FFFF.
* Display Multiplexing: Implements a logic for multiplexing the displays, where each display stays lit for 2.5ms while the other three are off (50 MHz Crystal), providing a continuous and readable display.

## Testbench

The testbench helps to visualize the simulated behavior of the implemented logic.

* Clock Signal (clk): Corresponds to the clock generated by a 50MHz crystal.
* Display Select Signal (sel_display): Corresponds to the display enable signal, where only one display remains active at a time. A logical level 0 activates the display since a PNP BJT is used for switching, as per the schematic diagram.
* Digit Signals (A, B, C, D): Correspond to the segments lit, with each signal corresponding to a digit of a 4-digit number, where A is the least significant digit and D is the most significant digit, whether hexadecimal or decimal. A logical level 0 activates the segment, as the display is common anode.
